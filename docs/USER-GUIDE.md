## Daily loops

### Capture and paste

1. **⌘⇧4** (selection), **⌘⇧3** (full screen), or **⌘⇧5** (toolbar).  
2. macOS writes the file into the **staging** folder first.  
3. The pipeline puts a paste-ready **PNG** on the clipboard first, imports the untouched **original** into Photos, then deletes the staging file (default mode).
4. **⌘V** into Notes, Discord, browser, editor, etc.

Window capture: **⌘⇧4**, then **Space**, click the window.

### Markup (Paint-like)

1. Capture (or copy any image).  
2. **⌘⇧E** — Preview opens with the clipboard image.  
3. If the markup bar is hidden, press **⇧⌘A**.  
4. Annotate → **⌘A** → **⌘C** → paste with **⌘V**.

### What does *not* use the pipeline

| Shortcut | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **⌘⌃⇧4** | Native clipboard-only; **no** file, **no** Photos import |
| Touch Bar / third-party capture tools | Only if they write into your staging folder |

## Photos

With default install, each processed capture is **imported into Photos.app** (library root / Recents). On the new item the script sets:

- `description` → caption (default `Screenshot`)
- `keywords` → `{ Screenshot }` (or your `KEYWORD`)
- `name` → caption only if Photos left the name empty

This project does **not** upload to iCloud. If **iCloud Photos** is enabled on the Mac, Apple may sync the library on its own schedule.

Google Photos (if you use it as a secondary sink) may or may not show Apple captions — outside this tool.

## Staging folder

Default: `~/Pictures/Camera Roll`.

- **Default mode:** after Photos import **succeeds** and the clipboard step runs, the staging file is **deleted**.  
- **Photos fails:** file **stays** (retry by fixing Automation and re-running `process.sh`). Clipboard PNG is still attempted.  
- **`--no-photos`:** installer sets `DELETE_STAGING_ON_SUCCESS=0` so files **remain** unless you change config.  
- **`--keep-staging`:** never delete after success.

## Config

Edit:

```text
~/.config/macos-screenshot-pipeline/config.env
```

Then either wait for the next capture or run:

```bash
~/.local/libexec/macos-screenshot-pipeline/process.sh
```

Changing **staging path** also requires updating the capture LaunchAgent WatchPaths — re-run `./install.sh --staging NEWPATH` (or see OPERATIONS).

`CLIPBOARD_MAX_DIMENSION=3840` keeps 5K/6K screenshots responsive while retaining the original in Photos. Set it to `0`, or reinstall with `--clipboard-full-resolution`, for a native-resolution paste copy.

## Temporarily disable

```bash
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)/com.travisjneuman.screenshotpipeline.capture"
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)/com.travisjneuman.screenshotpipeline.hotkey"
```

Re-enable by re-running `./install.sh` from the clone, or `bootstrap` the plists under `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

## Stock screenshots again

```bash
./uninstall.sh --restore-stock-screenshots
```

That clears the custom location (Desktop default returns) and turns the floating thumbnail back on. HDR preference is left alone.
